This repository is the official implementation of the [T-Mamba: A unified framework with Long-Range Dependency in dual-domain for 2D & 3D Tooth Segmentation
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01065.pdf).

More experiments are running üî•

We are conducting more experiments and analysis on 3D CBCT and 2D X-ray images, and will update the whole manuscript. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The code, pre-trained weights, and datasets will be fully available.

Currently, our T-Mamba supports 2D & 3D vision tasks. Welcome to try it for improving your model's performance.

The proposed TED3 dataset is available at: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Bryceee/TED3).

If u have any quesitons, pls feel free to drop me via isjinghao@gmail.com.
